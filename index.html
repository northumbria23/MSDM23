        </div>
        <p>
          <font size="+1">Multiagent sequential decision making under uncertainty (MSDM) is the problem multiple agents face when they aim to optimise their decisions over a finite or infinite number of time steps in a stochastic environment. It becomes increasingly complex when there is limited communication among the agents and the agents would act subjectively in a real-time interaction. The research problem is one of the core challenging issues in the agents planning community where researchers have developed a significant amount of research in the past decades. For example, a number of multiagent decision models, e.g. Dec-POMDP, MMDP and I-POMDP, have been well developed while a variety of different algorithms have been crafted to solve the models with the consideration of tractable computational complexity. However, the research challenges still exist particularly in an open AI world where unknown unknowns further complicate the agents’ interactions in both offline agent model and online plan execution.

          </font>
        </p>
        <p>
          <font size="+1">The purpose of this workshop is to revisit the previous research achievements and discuss potential solutions to the new challenges in the MSDM research. Meanwhile, it is noticed that data-driven AI with powerful deep learning have dramatically changed the AI research horizon, which also offers great opportunities to re-shape the MSDM research. Hence, this workshop aims to bring together researchers in the fields of agents planning, reasoning and learning, as well as general machine learning and data science. We expect to discuss new MSDM solutions and foster research collaboration so as to demonstrate the MSDM research in a set of impactful real-world applications, e.g. health, space, security and so on.

                      Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is an important decision problem for all multi-robot systems, but
                      with a huge array of solvers, it is difficult to decide which solver to use. In this presentation,
                      I will discuss our state-of-the-art MAPF algorithm selector that automatically chooses an optimal
                      MAPF solver to use to solve any instance. I will also discuss our work in trying to understand
                      what makes some MAPF instances hard to solve, which, in turn, can improve our algorithm selection.

                      The coordination of robots and other agents becomes more and more important for industry. For
                      example, on the order of one thousand robots already navigate autonomously in fulfillment centers
                      to
                      move inventory pods all the way from their storage locations to the picking stations that need the
                      products they store (and vice versa). Optimal and, in some cases, even approximately optimal path
                      planning for these robots is NP-hard, yet one must find high-quality collision-free paths for them
                      in real-time. Algorithms for such multi-agent path-finding problems have been studied in robotics
                      and theoretical computer science for a longer time but are insufficient since they are either fast
                      but of insufficient solution quality or of good solution quality but too slow. In this talk, I
                      will
                      discuss both recent cool ideas for solving such multi-agent path-finding problems (including the
                      roles of planning and machine learning) and several of their applications, including in
                      warehousing.

                      A challenge in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning is credit assignment, where it is
                      often difficult to determine when an agent contributes to a shared reward. This problem is
                      particularly hard for teams with many decentralized agents. In this talk, I will discuss common
                      approaches for addressing this problem from the perspective of learning individual utility
                      functions agents can use for decentralized decision making. I will then discuss our recent work in
                      this growing body of literature and how we leverage successor features to achieve promising
                      results.

                      A major challenge of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the curse of multiagents, where
                      the size of the joint action space scales exponentially with the number of agents. This remains to
                      be a bottleneck for designing efficient MARL algorithms even in a basic scenario with finitely
                      many states and actions. This paper resolves this challenge for the model of episodic Markov
                      games. We design a new class of fully decentralized algorithms---V-learning, which provably learns
                      Nash equilibria (in the two-player zero-sum setting), correlated equilibria and coarse correlated
                      equilibria (in the multiplayer general-sum setting) in a number of samples that only scales with
                      \max_i A_i, where A_i is the number of actions for the ith player. This is in sharp contrast to
                      the size of the joint action space which is \prod_i A_i. V-learning (in its basic form) is a new
                      class of single-agent RL algorithms that convert any adversarial bandit algorithm with suitable
                      regret guarantees into a RL algorithm. Similar to the classical Q-learning algorithm, it performs
                      incremental updates to the value functions. Different from Q-learning, it only maintains the
                      estimates of V-values instead of Q-values. This key difference allows V-learning to achieve the
                      claimed guarantees in the MARL setting by simply letting all agents run V-learning independently.

                      Some important breakthroughs in artificial intelligence in recent years (such as Libratus and
                      security games) can be attributed to the development of large-scale game solving technology in the
                      past decade. However, game solving technology cannot handle large scale complex games, and the
                      academic community began to use deep learning techniques to solve such complex games. The talk

                      </b>
                      In general-sum games, the interaction of self-interested learning agents commonly leads to
                      collectively worst-case outcomes, such as defect-defect in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD).
                      To overcome this, some methods, such as Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), shape
                      their opponents' learning process. However, these methods are myopic since only a small number of
                      steps can be anticipated, are asymmetric since they treat other agents as naive learners, and
                      require the use of higher-order derivatives, which are calculated through white-box access to an
                      opponent's differentiable learning algorithm.
                      In this talk I will first introduce Model-Free Opponent Shaping (M-FOS), which overcomes all of
                      these limitations. M-FOS learns in a meta-game in which each meta-step is an episode of the
                      underlying (``inner'') game. The meta-state consists of the inner policies, and the meta-policy
                      produces a new inner policy to be used in the next episode. M-FOS then uses generic model-free
                      optimisation methods to learn meta-policies that accomplish long-horizon opponent shaping.
                      I will finish off the talk with our recent results for adversarial (or cooperative) cheap-talk:
                      How can agents interfere with (or support) the learning process of other agents without being able
                      to act in the environment?

                      In this talk, I first discuss how we leverage machine learning methods to generate cooperative
                      policies for multi-robot systems. I describe how we use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn
                      effective communication strategies for decentralized coordination. I then show how our GNN-based
                      policy is able to achieve near-optimal performance across a variety of problems, at a fraction of
                      the real-time computational cost. Finally, I present some pioneering real-robot experiments that
                      demonstrate the transfer of our methods to the physical world.
